# ODE integrator for FYS3150 project 3
This is an example class structure for project FYS3150 project 3, 2016: The solar system. 

## Making this code a basis for your own project
If you wish, you may [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository and use it as a basis for your own code. If you do, you will have to implement a lot of the crucial functions yourself. The relevant functions you need to implement are spread throughout the project, but they are all commented with a note saying what each function should do.

Please note that this is only a start, and when you have implemented all of these functions you will only have completed the first part of the exercise. However, once this is done, you will have a very good basis for further work, and adding functionality will be easier with a good class structure.

- If you choose to use this code as a basis for your work, the first thing you should do is fork it, pull it down to your computer, and make sure it compiles and runs. After this you should spend at least 15 minutes looking at the structure and familiarizing yourself with how the classes interact with eachother.
